# DoH DNS Block Filter

This repository contains a script and a list for blocking publicly available DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) servers. The script automatically updates the list with the latest DoH server URLs, ensuring the block list is always up-to-date.

## How It Works

The `doh-update.sh` script fetches a list of publicly available DoH servers from a Markdown file in the `curl/curl.wiki` GitHub repository. It then extracts the base URLs of these DoH servers and compiles them into a block list, which can be used to prevent access to these servers.

The block list is updated regularly through a GitHub Actions workflow, ensuring that new entries from the source are included and that the list remains current.

## Subscribing to the Block List

To use this block list, you can subscribe to it in various applications that support external block lists. Here's a general guide on how to subscribe:

1. **Find the Subscription Option**: Open the settings of your application (e.g., AdGuard Home, Pi-hole) and locate the section where you can add or subscribe to block lists.

2. **Add the Block List URL**: Use the following URL to subscribe to the block list:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohamedElashri/doh-list/main/doh-list.txt
```


This URL points to the raw `doh-list.txt` file in this repository.

3. **Save and Update**: After adding the URL, save the changes and update your block lists. The application should fetch the latest version of the `doh-list.txt` file.

4. **Regular Updates**: Depending on your application settings, the list will be updated regularly to ensure that new DoH server URLs are blocked as they become available.
